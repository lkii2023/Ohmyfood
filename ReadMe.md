# Project 4 of the OpenClassrooms Web Developer Program: Enhancing a Website with CSS Animations

### Identity

**Ohmyfood** is an online food ordering company. Our concept allows users to create their own menu and reduce their wait time at restaurants, as their menu is prepared in advance. No more time wasted browsing through menus!

## Objectives

The project involves developing a website showcasing the menus of 4 major restaurants in Paris. The main features include online reservations and menu composition. Advanced CSS animations will be used to enhance the user experience.

## Deliverables

### Pages to Integrate

- Home pages
- Menu pages (total of 4)

### Animations

#### Buttons

On hover, the background color of the main buttons will slightly lighten. The drop shadow will also become more visible. Furthermore, a "Like" effect in the shape of a heart will be implemented. Initially, this effect can appear on hover rather than on click.

#### Home Page

As the application gains more menus, a "loading" will be necessary. In this design, a preview of this loading is required. It should display for 1 to 3 seconds upon opening the home page, covering the entire screen. CSS animations should be used for this feature.

### Menu Pages

Upon opening the page, dishes should appear progressively with a slight time delay. They can be displayed either individually or grouped as "Appetizers," "Main Courses," and "Desserts."

Visitors will have the ability to add their chosen dishes to their order by selecting them. This action will reveal a checkmark on the right side of the dish, sliding from right to left. In this initial version, the effect can appear on hover rather than on click. If the dish label is too long, it will be truncated with ellipses.

## Technologies

Allowed technologies: HTML, CSS, CSS preprocessor (e.g., Sass)
Prohibited technologies: JavaScript, inline CSS

## Graphic Identity

**Fonts**:
- Logo and titles: Shrikhand
- Text: Roboto

**Colors**:
- Primary: #9356DC
- Secondary: #FF79DA
- Tertiary: #99E2D0

## Compatibility

The website will be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The layout will be adapted for tablets and desktops, but priority is given to the mobile version.

The pages must pass W3C validation for HTML and CSS without errors.

The site will be fully compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox on desktop.
